                In a world shrouded in night, where the clash between divine light and demonic darkness rages on, the cleric-soldiers known as the Legion of Saints stand as the last bastion of hope. 
                Led by the enigmatic Master Theologians, they wield the powers of their divine Mother God, Heia, in a desperate struggle against the malevolent Curators and demons summoned 
                from the Inferno.

            they may yet emerge victorious, though the cost may be more than they can bear.
